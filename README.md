Functional vs Procedural vs OOP Programming. Example and explanation


Programming Paradigms: how you write and organize you code

1. Functional - organize code in pure functions with clearly defined tasks. Pass data around via parameters.

2. Object orineted - organize data and logic in objects and classess (properties + methods). organize code in logical entities.

3. Procedural - write sequential series of execution steps/task. Top to bottom code execution. We don't structure our code in logical maner.
